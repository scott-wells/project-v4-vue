# Portfolio v4.0.0

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a new portfolio that showcases my skills, work, as well as provides content other developers may find useful. Specifically, the content will be centered around tutorials, updates on projects and technologies I am working on, open source tools, and of course, a way for employers to get in contact with me.

## To Do:
-   add about section
